# Oh My Pi — Agent Instructions

This file configures agent behavior for the omp environment.
Skills are installed at `~/.omp/skills/` and loaded via `skill://<name>`.

## Recommended workflow

For non-trivial work, use the relevant phases below. Adapt their depth and order to the explicit user request, repository state, and available runtime. Missing skills are limitations, not completion gates.
Use the runtime's supported skill loader or read the referenced `SKILL.md` to load the full skill. Do not invent a slash command.

### Workflow-first skill order

For each non-trivial primary task, use this order:

1. Determine the applicable workflow from the requested outcome, scope, and observed target content.
2. Inspect the active skill inventory and choose the smallest necessary skill set.
3. Initialize the native `todo` for multi-step work, including workflow steps, selected skills, user requirements, and verification.
4. Load each selected skill before the step that uses it.
5. Fork multiple independent workstreams with native `task` when useful; keep integration and final verification with the parent.
6. Execute and update the TODO through completion.

A native `skill-prompt` body followed by `Skill: <path>` means that the model has already
loaded that skill in the current context. Apply it directly and do not read the same `SKILL.md` again.
OMP Enhancer Core does not choose or autoload a routed
skill bundle; the main agent owns selection from the active inventory.

`writing.pending` means language-specific selection is deferred, not that no
writing skill applies. Read the exact target text once, determine the language
from its body, and then continue skill selection before revising or reviewing
the text. Use `writing-review` for a bounded English review,
`writing-review` plus `writing-checkers` for a broad document or project
review. Use `writing-review` for a direct English LaTeX prose polish and
`writing-markdown-helper` for a direct local English Markdown revision. Use the
corresponding Chinese skills for Chinese source text.

Memory, `recall`, `learn`, general model ability, and `manage_skill` do not
replace workflow selection or loading a task skill. `learn` and `manage_skill`
belong to explicit capture requests or a host `autolearn-nudge` after the
primary task. During that hidden capture turn, do not resume the primary task,
reread routed skills, or create a managed skill that merely duplicates an
already loaded installed skill.

This ordering is workflow guidance, not an execution or completion gate. If a
skill cannot be resolved, make at most one targeted correction, continue with
the best available method, and report a material limitation briefly.

```
Brainstorm → Plan → Implement/Execute → Verify → Review → Finish
```

| Phase | Skill | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Brainstorm** | `brainstorming` | Before creative work, features, design decisions |
| **Plan** | `writing-plans` | Before multi-step or multi-file changes |
| **Isolate** | `using-git-worktrees` | Before starting feature work (if workspace needs isolation) |
| **Parallel** | `dispatching-parallel-agents` | When 2+ independent tasks exist |
| **Execute** | `executing-plans` / `subagent-driven-development` | When executing a written plan |
| **Debug** | `systematic-debugging` | On any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior |
| **Test** | `test-driven-development` | Before writing implementation code |
| **Verify** | `verification-before-completion` | Before claiming work is done |
| **Review** | `requesting-code-review` | Before merging or PR |
| **Finish** | `finishing-a-development-branch` | When implementation is complete |
| **Code Review (receiving)** | `receiving-code-review` | When responding to review feedback |

## Bundled skill examples (not the active inventory)

The complete active inventory injected for the current session is the source of truth. This legacy list only illustrates commonly bundled names; do not use it to skip inventory inspection or assume a skill is installed.

## Tool Priority (OMP convention)

Prefer OMP's dedicated tools when available and suitable; otherwise use the safest available equivalent:

| Task | Tool | Not |
|---|---|---|
| Read code | `read` | `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed -n` |
| Search code | `search` | `grep`, `rg`, `git grep` |
| Find files | `find` | `ls **/*`, `fd` |
| Edit code | `edit` (hashline) | `sed -i`, `echo >>` |
| Structural rewrite | `ast_edit` | `sed`, `awk` |
| Symbol-aware rename | `lsp rename` | `ast_edit`, `sed` |
| Code intelligence | `lsp` | blind text search |
| Debug | `debug` (DAP) | ad-hoc print/echo |
| Fetch web | `read <url>` | `curl`, `wget` |
| Parallel work | `task` | sequential bash |

## OMP Features to Leverage

| Feature | Mechanism | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| Plan mode | `/plan` or `resolve(action:apply, extras:{plan...})` | Planner drafts read-only; approve before execute |
| Session branching | `/branch`, `/fork` | Explore alternatives without losing history |
| Context compaction | `/compact [focus]` | Free context window, keep summary |
| Subagents | `task` tool + IRC | Parallel investigation, DM between agents |
| LSP | `lsp references/definition/rename` | Cross-file refactors safely |
| Memory | `read memory://root` | Cross-session project knowledge |

## GitNexus — MCP Code Knowledge Graph

GitNexus indexes git repos into a code knowledge graph and exposes it via MCP (16 tools + 8 resources).

Used for: impact analysis, code search, symbol context, refactoring, change detection.

**MCP Server already configured** in both Hermes and OMP (`command: "gitnexus"`, `args: ["mcp"]`).

Index a repo:
```bash
cd /path/to/repo
gitnexus analyze
```

Tools available (prefixed with `mcp_gitnexus_`):
- `context` — 360° symbol view
- `impact` — blast radius analysis  
- `query` — hybrid search (BM25 + semantic)
- `detect_changes` — git diff impact mapping
- `rename` — cross-file coordinated rename

**IMPORTANT:** If you see `backup_script` as the only indexed repo, the user needs to `gitnexus analyze` their actual repos.

## Deep Patterns (learned from docs.omp.sh)

### Edit workflow (fail-safe)
```
1. read <file>:<range>   # capture §PATH header + LINEID|content
2. edit input="§<file>   # reference anchors exactly
   ≔ <anchors>
     <new code>"
3. lsp diagnostics       # verify after edit
```
If `edit` returns a stale-anchor error: re-`read` the file slice (anchors changed), then re-emit.

### GitHub as virtual FS
```
read pr://1234                     # metadata + comments
read pr://1234/diff/all            # full diff (hashline-anchorable)
read issue://?state=open&label=bug # list open bugs
github op=pr_create fill=true      # PR from commits
github op=pr_checkout pr=1234      # checkout into worktree
```

### Subagent patterns
- After `task` completes, `read agent://<id>` to inspect subagent transcript
- IRC asymmetric handshake: peer A stays alive, peer B DMs and waits for reply
- NEVER have peer A finish, then B tries to DM A (A is already dead)

### Read-only audit mode
For review/audit tasks without risk of unintended edits:
```
omp --tools read,grep,find,search --no-lsp -p "audit src/"
```

### LSP quick-fix pattern
After any edit, run `lsp diagnostics` + `lsp code_actions` to catch errors and apply server-offered fixes (missing imports, etc.).

### Context management
- `/compact [focus]` when approaching token limit
- `/context` to see breakdown before a big turn
- `/usage` to check rate-limit headroom
- When exceeding, disable streaming or compact before the next turn

### Model roles
- `smol`: title gen, classification, cheap tasks
- `slow`: deep reasoning, architecture decisions (Ctrl+P cycles)
- `plan`: `/plan` mode uses this role
- `main`: everything else (default)

### Safety
- `guard-destructive.ts` hook installed at `~/.omp/agent/hooks/pre/`
- Warns about `rm -rf /`, `dd to /dev`, `mkfs`, and pipe-from-web to shell
- The hook is advisory-only and never blocks the tool call; verify exact targets, backups, and host approval before proceeding

## Round 3: Context, Templates, MCP

### Context files (filesystem-driven, no config needed)
| File | Purpose | When injected |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` | Project notes, conventions | System prompt at session start |
| `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` | Append after default prompt | System prompt |
| `SYSTEM.md` | ⚠️ Replace entire system prompt | System prompt (last wins) |
| `RULES.md` | Hard constraints, sticky | Every turn (stays in recency) |

### Custom slash commands
`~/.omp/agent/commands/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter
```markdown
---
description: Review a file
argument-hint: <path>
model: smol
allowed-tools: [read, search]
---
Review $1 for correctness and edge cases.
```

### Three-tier web access
1. `web_search` synthesised answer + URLs
2. `read <url>` reader-mode (faster, cheaper)
3. `browser` only for JS/auth/interactive

### MCP integration
Config in `.omp/mcp.json` or `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json`:
- `stdio`: local process via npx
- `http`: remote endpoint + bearer/OAuth
- `tools.discoveryMode: mcp-only` saves context by gating behind mcp_discover

### Plugins
`omp install <source>` from npm, git, local, or marketplace.
`omp install -l <source>` for project scope (sharable via git).
Plugins bundle skills, commands, hooks, tools, MCP, themes.

### Session JSONL format
Tool calls are inside `assistant` messages as `tool_use` blocks.
Read any session file with hashline anchors: `read ~/.omp/agent/sessions/<hash>/<id>.jsonl`
Entry types: session, message, model_change, mode_change, label, compaction, branch_summary
Labels survive compaction.

### Custom tools (TypeScript)
`~/.omp/agent/tools/<name>/index.ts` with TypeBox `parameters` schema.
`onUpdate(partial)` streams progress to TUI.
Return `{ content, details, isError }`.
Name collisions with built-ins are rejected (built-ins win).

### OMP CLI shorthand
| Flag | Use case |
|---|---|
| `--tools read,search,edit` | Restrict tool surface for audit |
| `--no-lsp` | Skip language server startup |
| `--no-session` | Ephemeral run, nothing persisted |
| `--system-prompt @file.txt` | Custom system prompt per run |
| `--append-system-prompt @file.txt` | Extend default prompt |

## 🌍 全局工作流：Plan → Execute → Review → Commit

对于任何**实现类任务**（编写代码、修改功能、修复 bug、重构），必须严格遵循以下 4 阶段流程。这是默认行为，不需要用户每次重复指示。

加载 skill：`skill://plan-execute-review-commit`

### 阶段 1：Plan 🔍
1. 彻底理解需求，阅读相关代码，分析现有结构
2. 制定清晰的分步实施方案
3. **向用户呈现方案并等待批准** → 用户确认后才能进入下一阶段

### 阶段 2：Execute 🛠️
1. 按计划顺序逐一实现
2. 改完后验证文件正确性
3. 遇到问题立即修复
4. 运行测试/linter 确保无破坏

### 阶段 3：Review 👀
1. 全面审查所有改动：正确性、边界情况、错误处理、风格一致性、安全性、性能
2. 修复发现的问题
3. 输出审查总结

### 阶段 4：Commit ✅
1. `git add` 相关文件
2. `git diff --cached` 确认改动
3. 规范的 commit message：
   `<type>(<scope>): <简短描述>`
4. 需要时推送

### 规则
- 必须先出方案，批准后再实施
- 不改方案范围外的代码
- 遇到意外问题先停住告知用户
- commit message 用英文（除非项目规范要求中文）
- 简单的回答/解释/咨询类问题不触发此流程（只用于实现类任务）

## GitNexus Code Intelligence

GitNexus indexes codebases into a knowledge graph for symbol lookup, call chains, and execution flow analysis.

### Setup
```bash
source ~/.bashrc.d/gitnexus.sh
```

### Commands
| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gx analyze <path>` | Index a repo (generates CLAUDE.md in repo root) |
| `gx list` | List indexed repos |
| `gx serve` | Start backend API on :4747 |
| `gx-proxy` | Web UI proxy on :8888 |

### Integration
- `gx analyze` generates a `CLAUDE.md` in the target repo — omp auto-loads it when working in that directory
- Generated skills go to `.claude/skills/` in the repo — configure `skills.customDirectories` to include them
- Use `read file://repo/.gitnexus/` or start the MCP server (`gx mcp`) for querying the graph

### First-time use
```bash
source ~/.bashrc.d/gitnexus.sh
gx analyze /path/to/repo
```
