# Itô Trade Planner

Use this skill when a user wants a structured worksheet for a prediction-market
idea, basket adjustment, venue comparison, or manual execution plan.

The skill is intentionally non-executing. It produces checklists and parameter
tables the user can review manually.

## Workflow composition boundary

Main selects supporting Skills in the initial `WORKFLOW PLAN` when they are
visible. This Skill does not select or auto-load another Skill, reroute the
workflow, or emit a replacement plan after `WORKFLOW READY`.

If this already-loaded guide reveals the risk method after PLAN, the remaining
linked-method batch may read only this exact same-namespace URI:

`RESOURCE EXTENSION | source=skill://ecc-skill-catalog/ito-trade-planner/SKILL.md | reads=skill://ecc-skill-catalog/prediction-market-risk-review/SKILL.md`

## Guardrails

- Do not say a trade is good, bad, optimal, or recommended.
- Do not provide investment advice or position sizing advice.
- Do not place, cancel, route, or sign orders.
- Do not request private keys, seed phrases, exchange passwords, or wallet
  credentials.
- Require explicit user approval before any workflow moves from research to
  execution-capable tooling.

## Planning Workflow

1. Restate the user's idea as a neutral hypothesis.
2. Identify markets, venues, underliers, resolution rules, fees, and data
   freshness constraints.
3. If `ITO_API_KEY` is configured and requested, read Itô basket metadata.
4. Build a manual worksheet:
   - market/underlier
   - venue
   - data source
   - current observable price or status
   - resolution rule
   - liquidity caveat
   - open questions
   - manual action link or next review step
5. Discuss automation, keys, venue auth, or capital constraints only when the
   committed plan includes the loaded `prediction-market-risk-review` method;
   otherwise stop at the manual worksheet and report that limitation.

## Allowed Language

Use:

- "manual planning worksheet"
- "questions to answer before acting"
- "observable venue data"
- "risk and constraint review"

Avoid:

- "you should buy/sell"
- "best trade"
- "guaranteed"
- "risk-free"
- "optimal size"

## Output Contract

End every plan with:

```text
This is a planning worksheet, not investment or trading advice. Review venue
rules and make any trading decisions yourself.
```
