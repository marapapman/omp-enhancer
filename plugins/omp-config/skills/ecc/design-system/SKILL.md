# Design System — Generate & Audit Visual Systems

## Runtime and authority boundary

Treat target-specific paths, slash commands, hooks, routers, model tiers, SHIP, or auto-fix behavior in this Skill as guidance for an external target system or runtime only if the user explicitly requests that target. For the current OMP session, this Skill does not route, hook, command, gate, control, grant permission, or decide completion; inspection, planning, and read-only review authorize no mutation. Any installation, configuration, file write, command, network call, upload, publication, payment, mutation, or other external effect requires explicit user authorization for the exact target and effect plus current native permission. Preserve fail-closed safety rules inside authorized target work; target safety is not an OMP gate or completion condition.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project that needs a design system
- Auditing an existing codebase for visual consistency
- Before a redesign — understand what you have
- When the UI looks "off" but you can't pinpoint why
- Reviewing PRs that touch styling

## How It Works

### Mode 1: Generate Design System

Analyzes your codebase and generates a cohesive design system:

```
1. Scan CSS/Tailwind/styled-components for existing patterns
2. Extract: colors, typography, spacing, border-radius, shadows, breakpoints
3. Research 3 competitor sites for inspiration (via browser MCP)
4. Propose a design token set (JSON + CSS custom properties)
5. Generate DESIGN.md with rationale for each decision
6. Create an interactive HTML preview page (self-contained, no deps)
```

Output: `DESIGN.md` + `design-tokens.json` + `design-preview.html`

### Mode 2: Visual Audit

Scores your UI across 10 dimensions (0-10 each):

```
1. Color consistency — are you using your palette or random hex values?
2. Typography hierarchy — clear h1 > h2 > h3 > body > caption?
3. Spacing rhythm — consistent scale (4px/8px/16px) or arbitrary?
4. Component consistency — do similar elements look similar?
5. Responsive behavior — fluid or broken at breakpoints?
6. Dark mode — complete or half-done?
7. Animation — purposeful or gratuitous?
8. Accessibility — contrast ratios, focus states, touch targets
9. Information density — cluttered or clean?
10. Polish — hover states, transitions, loading states, empty states
```

Each dimension gets a score, specific examples, and a fix with exact file:line.

### Mode 3: AI Slop Detection

Identifies generic AI-generated design patterns:

```
- Gratuitous gradients on everything
- Purple-to-blue defaults
- "Glass morphism" cards with no purpose
- Rounded corners on things that shouldn't be rounded
- Excessive animations on scroll
- Generic hero with centered text over stock gradient
- Sans-serif font stack with no personality
```

## Examples

**Generate for a SaaS app:**
```
/design-system generate --style minimal --palette earth-tones
```

**Audit existing UI:**
```
/design-system audit --url http://localhost:3000 --pages / /pricing /docs
```

**Check for AI slop:**
```
/design-system slop-check
```
