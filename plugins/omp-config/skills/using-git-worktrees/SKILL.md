# Using Git Worktrees

## Overview

Ensure work happens in an isolated workspace. Prefer your platform's native worktree tools. Fall back to manual git worktrees only when no native tool is available.

**Core principle:** Detect existing isolation first. Then use native tools. Then fall back to git. Never fight the harness.

**Effect boundary:** Worktree consent does not authorize modifying or committing `.gitignore`, dependency installation, downloads, network access, or branch cleanup. Obtain the user authorization required for each extra effect; native isolation or worktree creation does not broaden it.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace."

## Step 0: Detect Existing Isolation

**Before creating anything, check if you are already in an isolated workspace.**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
git status --short
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Record the current branch or detached state, commit, and dirty tree evidence before creating or entering isolation. Preserve user changes; isolation does not authorize cleaning either checkout.

**Submodule guard:** `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` is also true inside git submodules. Before concluding "already in a worktree," verify you are not in a submodule:

```bash
# If this returns a path, you're in a submodule, not a worktree — treat as normal repo
git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null
```

**If `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` (and not a submodule):** You are already in a linked worktree. Skip to Step 3 (Project Setup). Do NOT create another worktree.

Report with branch state:
- On a branch: "Already in isolated workspace at `<path>` on branch `<name>`."
- Detached HEAD: "Already in isolated workspace at `<path>` (detached HEAD, externally managed). Branch creation needed at finish time."

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (or in a submodule):** You are in a normal repo checkout.

Has the user already indicated their worktree preference in your instructions? If not, ask for consent before creating a worktree:

> "Would you like me to set up an isolated worktree? It protects your current branch from changes."

Honor any existing declared preference without asking. If the user declines consent, work in place and skip to Step 3.

## Step 1: Create Isolated Workspace

**You have two mechanisms. Try them in this order.**

### 1a. Native Worktree Tools (preferred)

The user has asked for an isolated workspace (Step 0 consent). Do you already have a way to create a worktree? It might be a tool with a name like `EnterWorktree`, `WorktreeCreate`, a `/worktree` command, or a `--worktree` flag. If you do, use it and skip to Step 3.

Native tools handle directory placement and lifecycle under the host's own contract. Using `git worktree add` when you have a native tool creates phantom state your harness can't see or manage. Do not perform separate branch cleanup unless the user authorizes it.

Only proceed to Step 1b if you have no native worktree tool available.

### 1b. Git Worktree Fallback

**Only use this if Step 1a does not apply** — you have no native worktree tool available. Create a worktree manually using git.

#### Directory Selection

Follow this priority order. Explicit user preference always beats observed filesystem state.

1. **Check your instructions for a declared worktree directory preference.** If the user has already specified one, use it without asking.

2. **Check for an existing project-local worktree directory:**
   ```bash
   ls -d .worktrees 2>/dev/null     # Preferred (hidden)
   ls -d worktrees 2>/dev/null      # Alternative
   ```
   If found, use it. If both exist, `.worktrees` wins.

3. **Check for an existing global directory:**
   ```bash
   project=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
   ls -d ~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/$project 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If found, use it (backward compatibility with legacy global path).

4. **If there is no other guidance available**, use a safe location outside the repository, such as the existing global directory convention. Do not create a project-local directory merely to establish a default.

#### Safety Verification (project-local directories only)

**MUST verify directory is ignored before creating worktree:**

```bash
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || git check-ignore -q worktrees 2>/dev/null
```

**If the project-local directory is not ignored:** Choose a safe location outside the repository or request single-effect authorization for the exact `.gitignore` modification. Worktree consent alone does not permit that edit or a commit.

**Why critical:** Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents to repository.

Global directories (`~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/`) need no verification.

#### Create the Worktree

```bash
project=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")

# Determine path based on chosen location
# For project-local: path="$LOCATION/$BRANCH_NAME"
# For global: path="~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/$project/$BRANCH_NAME"

git worktree add "$path" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
cd "$path"
```

**Sandbox fallback:** If `git worktree add` fails with a permission error, report that isolation was unavailable and work in the current directory only when allowed. Continue with the same effect-bounded setup and baseline rules below.

## Step 3: Project Setup

Detect the project's existing setup instructions without running them automatically. A setup command may install dependencies, write build artifacts, download content, or use the network. Run a setup command only when the current host, exposed tool, permission state, and user effect boundary all allow its effects. Otherwise report the exact command and effect that was not run; do not treat worktree consent as authorization.

Prefer an already-present dependency tree and an offline, read-only inspection when that can establish the needed baseline. Never invent a package-manager command from a manifest alone.

## Step 4: Verify Clean Baseline

Run a project-documented, host-authorized test command when it stays inside the allowed effect boundary. Capture the command, starting commit, dirty tree state, exit status, and concise output as baseline evidence. If tests cannot be run, report the missing baseline evidence and why.

```bash
# Use project-appropriate command
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed or investigate.

**If tests pass:** Report ready.

### Report

```
Worktree ready at <full-path>
Tests passing (<N> tests, 0 failures)
Ready to implement <feature-name>
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Already in linked worktree | Skip creation (Step 0) |
| In a submodule | Treat as normal repo (Step 0 guard) |
| Native worktree tool available | Use it (Step 1a) |
| No native tool | Git worktree fallback (Step 1b) |
| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |
| Neither exists | Check instructions, then use a safe location outside the repository |
| Global path exists | Use it (backward compat) |
| Project-local directory not ignored | Use an outside location or request one exact edit |
| Permission error on create | Sandbox fallback, work in place |
| Tests fail during baseline | Report failures + ask |
| Setup effects not authorized | Report the command and do not run it |

## Common Mistakes

### Fighting the harness

- **Problem:** Using `git worktree add` when the platform already provides isolation
- **Fix:** Step 0 detects existing isolation. Step 1a defers to native tools.

### Skipping detection

- **Problem:** Creating a nested worktree inside an existing one
- **Fix:** Always run Step 0 before creating anything

### Skipping ignore verification

- **Problem:** Worktree contents get tracked, pollute git status
- **Fix:** Always use `git check-ignore` before creating project-local worktree

### Assuming directory location

- **Problem:** Creates inconsistency, violates project conventions
- **Fix:** Follow the declared preference, safe existing paths, global path, then an explicitly authorized alternative

### Proceeding with failing tests

- **Problem:** Can't distinguish new bugs from pre-existing issues
- **Fix:** Report failures, get explicit permission to proceed

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Create a worktree when Step 0 detects existing isolation
- Use `git worktree add` when you have a native worktree tool (e.g., `EnterWorktree`). This is the #1 mistake — if you have it, use it.
- Skip Step 1a by jumping straight to Step 1b's git commands
- Create worktree without verifying it's ignored (project-local)
- Omit baseline evidence without reporting why it is unavailable
- Proceed with failing tests without asking

**Always:**
- Run Step 0 detection first
- Prefer native tools over git fallback
- Follow directory priority: declared preference > existing safe path > global path > authorized alternative
- Verify directory is ignored for project-local
- Respect the user effect boundary for setup, network, commits, and cleanup
- Capture baseline evidence or report why it is unavailable
